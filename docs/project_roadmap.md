# Project Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Initial Planning (Week 1)
### Set up Version Control and Repository
- Create Git repository and initialize file structure
- Write initial README.md and add basic .gitignore

### Environment Setup
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Create requirements.txt with
	•	Create a config.py and .env file to manage API keys and settings.
	•	Research:
	•	Investigate the Notion API documentation and choose an AI summarization tool (e.g., OpenAI’s API).

Phase 2: Article Content Extraction (Week 2)
	•	Develop Content Extraction Module:
	•	Implement article_processor.py using libraries such as requests and beautifulsoup4 to fetch and parse article content.
	•	Create utility functions in utils/text_extractor.py for cleaning and extracting main text.
	•	Testing:
	•	Write unit tests in tests/test_article_processor.py to verify content extraction.

Phase 3: AI Summarization Module (Week 3)
	•	Implement Summarization:
	•	Develop ai_agent.py to interface with your chosen AI summarization service.
	•	Create helper functions in utils/summarizer.py to format and refine the summary output.
	•	Integration Testing:
	•	Test the summarization functionality using sample articles.
	•	Write tests in tests/test_ai_agent.py.

Phase 4: Notion Integration (Week 4)
	•	Develop Notion API Module:
	•	Implement notion_integration.py to add or update a page in Notion with the summarized content.
	•	Handle authentication and error-checking for API calls.
	•	Testing:
	•	Create integration tests in tests/test_notion_integration.py to simulate Notion updates.
	•	Prototype Workflow:
	•	Build a simple command-line interface in src/main.py to tie together article fetching, summarizing, and updating Notion.

Phase 5: Refinement, Error Handling & UI Improvements (Week 5)
	•	Error Handling & Logging:
	•	Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the modules.
	•	User Interface Improvements:
	•	If desired, develop a simple GUI or enhance the CLI for better user experience.
	•	Testing:
	•	Expand tests to cover edge cases and potential failures.

Phase 6: Documentation & Final Review (Week 6)
	•	Documentation:
	•	Update README.md with installation, configuration, and usage instructions.
	•	Finalize project documentation in docs/project_roadmap.md and docs/design_notes.md.
	•	Code Review & Refactoring:
	•	Review the codebase for improvements, refactor where necessary, and ensure all tests pass.
	•	Deployment & Future Planning:
	•	Consider packaging your project or deploying it as a service.
	•	Plan for future features (e.g., multiple article input support, enhanced summarization techniques, etc.).
